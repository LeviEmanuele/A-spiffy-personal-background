# Human Instrumentality Project (don't sue me.) - a Personal profile for Social scientists 

Welcome to my personal profile: https://leviemanuele.github.io/A-spiffy-personal-background.github.io/ 

## About The Project

This project is about me making myself a personal profile, a simple psychologist. Showcasing how even a simple psychologist can survive the Internet with just an ounce of tech savyiness

### Why this project?

- **Focus on solving problems**: This project is designed to showcase my tech skills in this Dark Forest (great book, by the way)
- **Saves time**: Steal this template, scrape it or clone it - even social scientists deserve to survive and thrive on Github

## Built With

This section lists the major frameworks/libraries used in your project.

- Node.js
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Git
- Html
- Virtual Studio Code
- AI models to fix my behavioral issues and some code (hi GPT)
- the emulation of those who inspired my, say hi to https://github.com/Roey-Shap and its interesting Font Lerp projects

## Getting Started

This is how you can get the project up and running on your local machine: open Gpt and ask it to scrape my page. Or study html. Or both.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed. 

And a Github account, as it doesn't hurt.
